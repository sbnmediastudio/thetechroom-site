        <h1>NVIDIA’s AI Boom: Far From Over Despite Tepid Sales Forecasts</h1>
    </section>

    <article class="section" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>Introduction: As of August 28, 2025, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang reaffirmed that the AI revolution is in its early innings, despite a tempered sales forecast that sent shares dipping. In a Reuters interview, Huang highlighted ongoing investments in AI infrastructure, projecting sustained demand for GPUs.</p>
        <p>Body: NVIDIA's Q2 earnings showed record revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% from a year ago, but forward guidance was cautious amid supply chain tweaks. Yet, analysts see this as a blip; McKinsey's 2025 tech trends rank AI as the top impact driver. Global semiconductor sales are forecasted at $700.9B, per Microchip USA, fueled by AI chips. Competitors like Intel secure deals with the Trump admin for US manufacturing leadership, investing in fabs to counter China's e-beam lithography advances.</p>
        <p>AI's Broader Impact: The boom squeezes non-tech sectors, per The Economist, with AI investments propping US GDP but raising bubble fears (PBS report). Startups like Hemi raise millions for AI-blockchain fusion. The stock market volatility in August 2025, with Dow dropping over 1000 points, underscores economic uncertainty, but tech remains resilient.</p>
        <p>Detailed Analysis: NVIDIA's data center revenue hit $41.1B, slightly missing estimates, but gaming and professional visualization grew 16%. Blackwell chips delay to Q1 2026, but Hopper demand remains strong. In economics, US job market cools with 142K jobs added in August, unemployment at 4.2%. AI displaces jobs but creates new ones in programming and ethics. Global trade deficits narrow, with tech exports up.</p>
        <p>Future Outlook: With Google investing $9B in AI data centers and Microsoft releasing Phi 3.5 models, the ecosystem thrives. Challenges include energy consumption—AI data centers could use 8% of US power by 2030. Regulations like California's AI safety bill aim to mitigate risks.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: NVIDIA's trajectory points to dominance; watch for Blackwell chip launches. The AI era is far from peaking—it's accelerating. This positions NVIDIA as a key player in the $1T AI market by 2030.</p>
